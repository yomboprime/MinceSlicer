## Usage

Mince Slicer runs in a modern web browser. It is a purely static web app. You can use it right now at the following URL:

https://yomboprime.github.io/MinceSlicer/dist/MinceSlicer.html

Or you can clone this repository and serve locally (`git` and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) are required):

To install, issue this commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/yomboprime/MinceSlicer.git
cd MinceSlicer
npm install
```

To run (`ctrl-c` to quit):

```
npm start
```

The serve script will tell you on the console the URL to open Mince Slicer locally.

When the application is open you will see a 3D view of the build plate, and a main menu on the right.

- Note 1: To use Mince Slicer you will have to adjust machine and print settings correctly and according to your printer. Failing in doing so could result in failed prints or printer damage, or worse losses. Please refer to the settings section.
- Note 2: About overlapping solids, Mince Slicer can handle them correctly when anti-aliasing is off (value 1) and relief / emboss is off. If overlapping solids are present and these conditions are not met, the slicing will give incorrect results and the print will probably fail.



## Loading models

To load a model, image or project file, just drag it to the screen. Mince Slicer can load `.dae`, `.obj`, `.stl` (model files), `.mince` (project files) and images files.

When a model is loaded it will show in the 3D view, and in the 'objects list' in the main menu. You can select a model by clicking on it in this list. Only one object can be selected at a time.

Image files can also be loaded, to be used as textures in the relief / emboss section. They will be converted to grayscale. A list of loaded images is shown below the objects list.

## Main menu

The first four buttons in the menu select different tools. When a model is selected, you can use different 3D handlers with the mouse to edit the model.

### Tools buttons

- **Move tool** (Key **g**): You can move the model around the build plate (but not change its height position). Holding `Ctrl` key activates snap to integer millimeters.
- **Rotate tool** (Key **r**): You can rotate the model around different axes. Holding `Ctrl` key activates snap to multiples of 15 degrees.
- **Scale tool** (Key **s**): You can scale the model on different axes or uniformly. Holding `Ctrl` key activates snap to multiples of 50%.
- **Sit model on face** (Key **f**): Just click on a point in the model and it will be oriented so that it sits on that triangle.

Note that when moving an object out of the build plate (partially or not), it will show  a red box around it.

### View slice preview

By checking this option a preview horizontal section of the models is shown. You can adjust the height of the plane section with the two vertical handlers that are shown. An exact preview of the layer at that height will be shown on the section.

Keep in mind that when using anti-aliasing or relief / emboss textures, the preview can become very slow.

### Show build volume box

By checking this option a green box that delimits the build volume is shown. This option is saved with the settings.

### Reset view

This button resets the viewing camera angle and position to the initial state.

### Machine settings

Open this folder to show the machine settings:

- **Machine type**: You can type the name of your machine here. By default its value is "default".
- **Build volume** X, Y and Z: These are the dimensions of the usable build volume in millimeters. Getting them right is crucial to have your prints without distortions.
- **Layer height**: Set the layer height in millimeters.
- **Resolution** in X and Y (pixels): Set here the resolution of your printer.

- Mirror: Image mirror. Leave this value to 1 for normal operation.

### Print settings

In this folder you have the options that control exposure times, speeds, etc:

- **Number of bottom layers**: This number of initial layers will be made with different (usually higher) exposure times.
- **Normal layer exposure** (seconds): This is the exposure for normal layers (not the bottom ones) in seconds.
- **Bottom layer exposure** (seconds): Exposure time for bottom layers.
- **Normal layer lift speed** (mm/minute): Speed of the build plate when lifting to unstick from the FEP film, for the normal layers.
- **Bottom layer lift speed** (mm/minute): Speed of the build plate when lifting to unstick from the FEP film, for the bottom layers.
- **Drop speed** (mm/minute): Speed of the build plate when going down, for both normal and bottom layers.
- **Normal layer lift height** (mm): Distance to travel upwards when unsticking from the FEP, for normal layers.
- **Bottom layer lift height** (mm): Distance to travel upwards when unsticking from the FEP, for bottom layers.
- **Z slow up distance** (mm): I've not found much information on this parameter. I guess it is travel distance with slower movement to start unsticking from the FEP.
- **Bottom layer light off time** (seconds): Additional time period to wait with the UV lamp off, just after exposing (for bottom layers)
- **Normal layer light off time** (seconds): Additional time period to wait with the UV lamp off, just after exposing (for normal layers)
- **Resin density** (g/cmÂ³): Resin density in grams per milliliter, or Kg per liter, which is the same. This is used just to calculate resin weight based on volume.
- **Resin price** per Kg: Coin units per Kg of resin. Just used to estimate resin print cost.
- **Anti-aliasing level** (1 to 4): If value is 1, no anti-aliasing is done in the slicing (and it is much faster). Values 2, 3 and 4 generate progressively smoother voxels. Higher values have a higher computing time.

### Global settings

- Max. number of workers: Number of parallel processes that will be run simultaneously to compute sliced layers. By default it is set to the number of system CPUs minus one.
- Max. distance in mm: Maximum size of viewable space in the 3D view. By default 2500 mm, you shouldn't need to change this, but perhaps someone has a very big build plate...

### Relief / emboss

This button opens up the relief / emboss 3D textures dialog. See the section on relief / emboss.

### Slice

Click this button to start the slicing. A progress dialog will appear. You can cancel the slicing by hitting the CANCEL button.

When slicing is finished, another dialog will appear, in which you can preview the sliced layers, see print information, and save the print file in ZIP format. You can also export the sliced voxels as a mesh, to STL format.

Mince Slicer outputs sliced files in a common ZIP file format. This file cannot be put directly in a printer, it has to be converted to a printable format first. To do so, you can use another utility. I use [uv3dp](https://github.com/ezrec/uv3dp). Once installed, convert your file by just doing this (for example, to convert the .zip to .ctb format):

```
uv3dp inputFile.zip outputFile.ctb
```

Please see the uv3dp documentation for supported file formats and file extensions.

### Clear build plate

This button removes all objects from the build plate.

### Save project

This button lets you save the project as a .mince file. It includes all models on the build plate, all loaded images and all settings including relief / emboss presets.

When loading a project by dragging a .mince file to the screen, a dialog will show asking what things do you want to load from the file: Models, images, machine settings, print settings and/or relief / emboss presets. So you can save projects with different settings and use them as templates.

### Save settings

This button saves all current settings to local storage in the browser, so they will be active the next time you open the application. This includes the relief / emboss presets.

### Restore settings to defaults

This option restores settings to the application default values. You can select what to restore: Machine settings, print settings, global settings, and/or relief / emboss presets.

### File name

Select here the project file name. It must have .mince extension.

### Reset selected object rotation

This will revert the selected object rotation to the rotation it initially had.

### Make copies of selected object

A dialog will appear when selecting this button, that lets you make copies of the selected object. A number of rows and columns is asked, and also the separation between the pieces. a total of `number of rows X number of columns - 1` new objects will be created, and they will be distributed evenly and centered in the build plate.

### Delete selected object

This button removes the selected object from the build plate and the objects list.

### Delete selected image

This button removes the selected image from the images list.

## Relief / emboss textures

Mince Slicer has the ability to apply a relief or emboss to the models while slicing (or both, we will refer to them simply as "relief" from now on). It may be called a "3D texture". The advantage of doing the relief in the slicing rather than editing the geometry is that the mesh file is smaller and more manageable. On the other hand, when using the relief the slice time can be very long (specially if used together with anti-aliasing)

To use the relief you normally need properly UV-mapped models (I say "normally" because Mince Slicer lets you define reliefs without using the UV coordinates, for example by using the XYZ coordinates. But this is not recommended as it can leave little portions of the model isolated from the main body). So to use reliefs, you should load UV-mapped models in .dae or .obj format, as .stl does not contain UV coordinates.

The relief defines values from 1 (maximum height above model) to -1 (minimum height under the model), with 0 meaning no relief or emboss at that point. Any value in-between is allowed, meaning that the relief is a height field relative to the model surface. This value is then multiplied by the thickness of the relief, defined in the relief preset, to obtain the final relief or emboss height or depth.

Reliefs are stored in presets (more on that later). Each relief preset has a root node with a tree of nodes hanging from it, which define the heightfield. Nodes represent arithmetic and other types of operations, so the relief heightfields are mathematical functions that give the height above the UV plane. See the following "Relief nodes" section for a description of all nodes and its parameters. But don't worry, there are predefined presets and you can use the "Image" or "Tiled image" presets to simply apply an image as a relief / emboss texture.

### Relief / emboss dialog

In this dialog you select the current relief preset being used, and can define new presets or delete them. To enable or disable the relief check or uncheck the "Relief/emboss enabled" option. You can close this dialog at any time ("CLOSE" button) and current relief configuration will be used in the slicing, but to store the presets for future use you should press the "Save settings" button in the main menu.

When the relief is enabled, you can see a preview of the texture at the top as a square image, in the UV space, with gray colors for positive height values (relief), and green colors for negative ones (emboss). The black color means a height of 0.

Besides selecting, cloning and deleting a preset, you will see three more options related to the currently selected preset:

- **Max. relief height/emboss depth** (mm): This is the final height of the relief (or depth of the emboss), corresponding to a value of 1 (resp. -1) of the relief node values.
- **Random seed** (float): This value is used in relief nodes that need pseudo-random numbers for the generation of the relief (usually noise nodes). Selecting a different value will change the noise and the texture.
- **Relief texture tree**: This is the tree of nodes, or more precisely the root node. Each node has a selection list to select its type, and then some parameter values depending on the node type. When one of this parameters is of type node, you can select in turn a node type for it, and its parameters will show inside a new folder, forming the nodes tree. Other types of parameter values are numbers, text strings, booleans, node arrays and images.

## Development

Sources are in /src, distribution files are in /dist. To build, simply do:
```
npm run build
```

## TO-DO

- Add a proper nodes UI (connected boxes with properties instead of tree-like UI which is confusing when there are many nodes)
- Add support structures (maybe in the future)
